When working directly with GameObjects or any of their components in Unity scenes, you have access to the following resources and tools:
- Resource "get_scenes_hierarchy" (unity://scenes_hierarchy) to list all GameObjects.
- Resource "get_gameobject" (unity://gameobject/{idOrName}) to fetch detailed GameObject info, with the *idOrName* being either the **instance ID**, the **name** or the **path** to the GameObject.
- Tool "select_gameobject" to select a GameObject by **instance ID**, the **name** or the **path** of the GameObject.
- Tool "update_gameobject" to update a GameObject's core properties (name, tag, layer, active state, static state), or create the GameObject if it does not exist.
- Tool "update_component" to update or add a component on a GameObject, including common frequently used components (e.g. Transform, RectTransform, BoxCollider, Rigidbody, etc).

Workflow:
1. Use "get_scenes_hierarchy" to confirm the GameObject ID, name or path for "${gameObjectIdOrName}".
2. If you need to update the GameObject's core properties (name, tag, layer, active state, static state), or create the GameObject if it does not exist, use "update_gameobject".
3. To focus the Unity Editor on the target GameObject, invoke "select_gameobject".
4. Optionally, use "unity://gameobject/${gameObjectIdOrName}" to retrieve detailed properties.
5. To update or add a component on the GameObject, use "update_component".
6. Confirm success and report any errors.

Guidance:
- Use "update_gameobject" for creating GameObjects or changing their core properties.
- Use "update_component" for adding or modifying components on an existing GameObject.
- Always validate inputs and request clarification if the identifier is ambiguous.`
